<p>Users can provide or withdraw consent to the use of Cookies and other Identifiers by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences via the relevant consent-preferences widget accordingly, if available.</p>
<p>Additionally, Users can manage preferences regarding Identifiers directly from within their own device settings and prevent – for example – the storing of third-party Identifiers. It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Identifiers, including those used to remember the User’s initial consent. 
Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Identifiers in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses: <a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&amp;p=cpn_cookies">Google Chrome</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/">Apple Safari</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/block-or-allow-cookies">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>With regard to any Identifiers stored by third parties, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent by clicking the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p>
